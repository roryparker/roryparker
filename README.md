ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Rory

After supporting products and services for several years at various companies, I made the decision to build them. I took on Web Development and System Design techniques and gained interesting new perspectives and skills.

  <p> I am comfortable with Javascript, HTML, CSS. And I am working with COBOL! I have several projects in the works. Ask me about them! </p>
  <p> Talk to me on LinkedIn, Email, or Instagram </p>
