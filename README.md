ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Rory

Although my day entails being a Support Engineer, by night I'm acquiring Software Engineer and System Design skills and to become well-rounded and confident. 

I am comfortable with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and COBOL! I have several projects in the works. Ask me about them!

You can send an Email me or find me on Instagram!
