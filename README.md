ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rory

Although my day entails being a Support Engineer, by night I am working on Site Reliability and Software Engineering skills and techniques. I am comfortable with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and COBOL. 

I am working on several projects to help be well rounded and confident. Ask me about any of them!

You can send an Email me or find me on Instagram!
