ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Rory

After supporting products and services for several years at various companies, I made the decision to build them. I moved into software engineering. I took on Web Development and System Design techniques and gained interesting new perspectives and skills.

I am comfortable with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and COBOL! I have several projects in the works. Ask me about them!

You can send an Email me or find me on Instagram!
